# OSSP-assignment-
This is my OSSP assignment 

**Installation**


This project documents my installation and setup of the OpenIndiana operating system, an open-source Unix OS derived from Illumos and a continuation of the OpenSolaris legacy. The goal of this installation was to explore a Unix-like environment for educational purposes, particularly focusing on system programming and operating system concepts.

**system call()**


This section of the project focuses on understanding and working with the mount() system call in the OpenIndiana operating system, a derivative of Illumos and part of the OpenSolaris family.the Objective is to study how the mount() system call works in OpenIndiana, including its syntax, usage, and behavior when mounting file systems, as part of gaining practical experience with system-level programming in a Unix-like environment.
